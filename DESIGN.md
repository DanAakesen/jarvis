# Design

The shared shell and voice-workspace structure were agreed with Dan on 4 October 2026; final styling remains open. See [the complete UI discussion and wireframes](ui.md). Dan designs each page by giving an image generator the page's data points and actions from [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md#page-requirements), then picks a direction. Record the chosen direction, references, and findings here. Requirements stay in PRODUCT.md; token values go in code.

## Design goals

- **Conversation first.** Jarvis's main page is the conversation (chat and voice) with an overview of what is happening now. It may be the only page Dan uses day to day; area pages hold the details.
- **One app, many areas.** One app shell with area navigation. The Software Factory is the first area; later areas (Banking, Health and fitness, Calendar) must fit without redesigning the shell.
- **Live and honest.** State changes appear without refresh. Stale or disconnected data is shown as such; progress uses observed milestones, not invented percentages.
- **Full transparency.** Every task shows what the agent did, what it used, and what it cost.

## Page set (phase 1)

| Page | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| Jarvis (main) | Conversation, voice state, "now" activity, sleep switch |
| Task view | Kanban columns by task state |
| Task detail | Header, complete paginated event timeline, sandbox sessions, usage, and timestamped writable-disk total/free readings with low-disk threshold |
| Release view | Horizontal git graph per project (branches as lines, commits as dots), releases, workflow runs, deployments |
| Projects | Project list and settings |
| Settings | Models, reasoning, voices, limits, credential status |
| Usage and cost | Usage by task, project, and period |

The repository `PLAN.md` status workflow is GitHub metadata; it does not add a Jarvis UI control or visual state.

Events archived after 90 days load through the same task-detail timeline and pagination; the archive is invisible to the user.
The disk section uses recorded task events, not a live filesystem estimate; show
each reading's time and byte-derived human-readable values without implying that
the current filesystem state is available.

## Task usage (P2-12)

The task detail route presents usage in a compact, semantic table rather than
summary tiles. Each sandbox session has its own minutes and estimated DKK; agent
turns and any provider-reported metrics remain separate rows, with no fabricated
cost for subscription use. The neutral shell carries explicit loading, empty,
failure/retry, and populated states. On narrow screens only the table scrolls
horizontally; the page itself stays within the viewport. Usage is part of the
task detail response and appears alongside the task metadata, disk readings, and
event timeline.

## Interactions to design

- **Voice states:** listening, thinking, speaking, interrupted, reconnecting. Show what Jarvis heard. English uses Ryan HD and a British butler persona; action confirmations reflect backend tool results.
- **Teams confirmation cards (P7-03):** one Adaptive Card headline names the action, body text gives its bounded summary, and ordinary supporting text states the five-minute expiry. Approve and Reject are explicit, distinct buttons; optional speech is a separate, non-autostarting audio attachment. This interaction lives in Teams and does not add browser UI.
- **Language toggle:** Danish ↔ English, visible wherever voice is active.
- **Task controls:** steer, pause, resume, cancel, recover after a crash, and continue after a completed turn's session expires. Show a clear pending state (for example, "Continuing…" while a fresh session starts).
- **Sleep switch:** the main page shows configured awake/asleep state (minimum replicas 1/0), pending and failure feedback, and explains a refusal while any task is Ready or Running. Settings links to the main-page control.
- **Live updates:** cards and timeline entries change state without layout jumps; a visible marker for a disconnected or stale event stream. Only committed task updates are presented as current.

## Visual direction

Dan's brief (4 October 2026): the UI should be stunning, with rich styling and motion, and feel alive when Jarvis is doing something, especially in voice mode. Three original animated concepts are in [docs/ui/concepts](docs/ui/concepts/README.md) with screenshots. Selected on autopilot for Dan's review: **Concept B, living aurora**, as the default dark appearance, and **Concept C, daylight studio**, as the light appearance. Concept A's precise ring and tick detail is not used.

- **Why B:** its slowly flowing light field and fluid orb make Jarvis feel alive, and the orb's shape follows the audio level and runtime state, so the motion carries information rather than decoration. The futuristic assistant identity is the product reason for its restrained glow and translucent windows.
- **Motion language:** state changes and Jarvis's actions animate in place (orb morph per state, shimmer on the window Jarvis is updating, rows slide into tables, windows carry across when voice starts and the orb grows from the composer's small orb). Motion is interruptible, uses transform and opacity, pauses in hidden tabs, and falls back to fades with readable state labels under reduced motion.
- **Light appearance (C):** warm neutral surfaces and editorial typography with an ink-particle orb, so light mode keeps the same states and motion vocabulary.
- **Constraints kept:** every orb state is also labelled in text; no gradient text, no emoji icons, no lone coloured borders; sample data appears in the concepts only.

Token values belong in `apps/web/src/styles.css`; P8-20 (#282) implements this visual and motion system across the shell.

## Voice end (P8-12, decided 4 October 2026)

Escape ends voice; when a menu or dialog is open, the first Escape closes it. A visible **End voice** control (icon and label) sits directly below the orb on desktop and inside the bottom dock, right of the orb, on phone. Ending voice collapses the orb back into the composer's small orb. A natural spoken ending also ends voice; the small composer orb only starts voice.

## Foundation shell (P0-02)

The temporary shell uses system typography, neutral surfaces, one content column
and a compact Jarvis home link. It establishes responsive and keyboard behavior
without choosing the future product identity. Canonical styles live in
`apps/web/src/styles.css`. The signed-out page states that sign-in and deployment
are pending; no fake task data is shown. P1-07 shows unbuilt actions as explained,
disabled controls; see below. Unknown addresses have a return link. A skip link
and visible keyboard focus support navigation. Dan's page designs remain to be selected.

## Sign-in (P0-09)

The home page keeps the neutral, single-column shell and presents one Microsoft
sign-in action. Disable it with an explanation until the backend is configured;
show pending and refusal feedback beside the action. After `/me` verifies the
session, show the returned name as the page headline. Do not expose account
tokens, email addresses, or unverified identity claims in the interface.

## App shell (P1-07)

The shell keeps the neutral foundation and adds structure only, without a
visual direction. The header contains the Jarvis home link, area navigation
(Software Factory only) and a separate Settings entry. The current page is marked with a
surface fill and full outline, never a lone edge. Navigation appears only after
sign-in; the header wraps on narrow screens.

- **Database wake (P1-14):** one shared, polite status message above the page
  content reads “Waking Jarvis…” while the backend reports a resume wait.
  Keep the current page and pending controls visible; do not infer this state
  from elapsed time or replace it with an invented progress indicator.

- **Main page:** the verified name is the headline. Conversation (chat,
  language, voice, and persisted history) is the wide column; "Now" and Backend
  sit beside it from 900 px and stack below it on narrower screens.
- **Unavailable features:** each data area says what it will show. Each action
  stays visible but disabled, and is linked to that explanation with
  `aria-describedby`. No sample messages, tasks or states are shown.
- **Activity panel:** Running tasks, Needs attention, Releases and deployments,
  Credential warnings, and Alerts, each with an empty state. Item titles open their
  task, release or project. Dismiss shows "Dismissing…", keeps the item and
  explains a failure, and returns focus to the Now heading after removal.
  The panel loads its backend snapshot, offers retry when unavailable, and
  labels reconnecting or unavailable live updates while keeping the last
  snapshot visible.
- **Alerts (P6-02):** Keep alerts in the existing Now activity panel as a
  separate, dismissible "Alerts" group; retain the condition title, timestamp,
  and task/release/project link where one exists. Budget alerts have no invented
  page or cost estimate. The group uses the shell's existing neutral list and
  responsive layout; no new palette or alert-only visual language is needed.
- **Area pages:** the Software Factory has its own Tasks and Projects
  navigation. Unbuilt task and release pages explain what is unavailable.
  Project management is implemented below; record pages link back to their list.
- The P1-07 shell was checked in headless Chromium at 300, 390, 768 and 1280 px
  with a stubbed sign-in: no horizontal overflow, and controls are at least 44 px high.

## Settings (P1-11)

Keep the Settings route within the shell's neutral foundation. Use one page
headline and distinct form sections for Jarvis, Voice, Coding agents, Global,
New projects, and Credentials. New-project controls use the documented defaults
and the same labelled field grid as the other sections. Two columns make related controls easy to scan on wide screens;
the form stacks on narrow screens. Save feedback stays beside the save action,
and loading, recovery, and unavailable actions remain explicit. Credentials show text status, expiry, and last-updated dates without secret
values; manual renewal and reseed controls remain disabled with an explanation.
The sleep control also remains disabled until its owning workflow exists; no
new visual direction or palette is introduced. Checked in Chromium at
390 and 1280 px with mock auth/settings: no horizontal overflow, controls at
least 44 px high, and save/disabled states visible. Live backend behavior remains
unverified.

## Projects (P1-10)

Keep the neutral foundation. The list uses one compact project panel per
repository, with its settings, running-task count, last-release availability,
and edit action grouped for scanning. Project settings use labelled form
sections; save, archive confirmation, loading, retry, conflict, and
success feedback stay close to the relevant actions. The Projects page has no
creation form; an empty list points users to New projects defaults in Settings.
Archive messaging explains
that history remains and the repository stays reserved. Counts refresh manually
until live updates exist; missing release data is stated, not fabricated.
Checked in Chromium 154 at 390 and 1280 px with scratch-only auth and API mocks:
list, create, update, and archive worked; neither width overflowed, controls
were at least 44 px high, and the project form stacked on mobile. Live Entra and
Azure SQL behavior remains unverified.
P3-11 rechecked Settings and Projects in Chromium 154 at 390 and 1280 px with
scratch-only auth and API mocks. New-project settings save, the Projects page has
no create link or form, and neither width overflows; controls remain at least
44 px high. Live Entra and Azure SQL behavior remains unverified.
P3-13 keeps installed repositories below managed projects in the same neutral
layout. Each unmanaged repository shows its owner/name, last push, and language
with a single **Manage with Jarvis** action; the existing toolbar refreshes both
projects and repositories. Chromium 154 checks at 390 and 1280 px exercised
management without a form and explicit refresh. Neither width overflowed, buttons
were 44 px high, and there were no browser errors. Live GitHub App, Entra, and
Azure SQL behavior remains unverified.

## Task view (P1-08)

Continue the neutral foundation and put the create action and filters before the
board. Keep the six task states as distinct columns; columns stack on narrow
screens, use two columns at tablet widths, and scroll horizontally on wide
screens. Cards group task facts as labelled details, with the state always
written as text. The create dialog uses labelled fields and keeps pending and
failure feedback beside its actions. A shared task-controls component offers
steer/pause while Running, resume while Paused, and cancel only after confirmation.
Pull request, checks, and usage remain
explicitly "Not reported" until the backend provides those values.

Checked in Chromium at 1280 and 390 px with scratch-only auth and API mocks:
task creation, SSE-driven card refresh, Escape dismissal with focus return, and
filters worked. Neither width overflowed the page, modal content fit on mobile,
and controls were at least 44 px high. Live Entra, Azure SQL, and deployed SSE
behavior remain unverified.

## Task detail (P1-09)

The page extends the neutral Factory layout with a labelled task summary, a compact
metadata grid, and separate sections for state-aware task actions, recorded disk readings, usage,
the originating conversation message, and the event timeline. The timeline remains chronological and shows all event
sources by default; users can filter by event type, expand bounded event payloads,
and request additional event pages. Its connection state stays visible beside the
filter. Controls display pending, success, and error feedback beside the action;
unavailable PR/artifact links have adjacent explanations rather than implying an
action is ready.

Needs attention presents a Recover action with a short explanation that recovery
starts a new sandbox from the task branch and saved history. The action keeps its
identity while pending and reports success or failure beside the control.

At narrow widths the metadata and controls stack into one column and timeline
payloads scroll within the page. Existing 44 px controls and focus styles are
reused. The usage section is an explicit P2-12 slot; disk values remain based on
recorded events rather than a live filesystem estimate.

## Usage and cost (P6-01)

The page uses the existing neutral app shell, with one page heading followed by
labelled period and grouping controls. Project, agent, and source groups contain
semantic tables of task-linked usage; rows show the source, metric, quantity,
available DKK, and last-used time. Codex/Copilot costs stay absent, while
sandbox and voice amounts are labelled estimates. The page identifies partial
results when the 1,000-row API cap applies.

Controls stack on narrow screens and only the table region can scroll
horizontally. Loading, empty, and retryable failure states keep the selected
filters visible. Task links open the existing task-detail route.

Chromium inspection at 390 and 1280 px verified all three groupings, period
changes, task links, and retry/empty states with scratch-only auth and API mocks.
The page had no horizontal overflow, controls measured 44 px high, and the table
kept its own horizontal scrolling region. Live SQL and provider/voice data remain
unverified.

## Conversation history (P4-03)

After sign-in, the main page shows the persisted conversation in chronological
order across chat and voice sessions. Each message has its speaker and time;
tool calls show the tool and outcome, with a task link when available.
History loads in bounded pages, with older entries requested explicitly. Loading,
empty, and retryable failure states remain within the conversation panel. This is
an interim implementation, not a selected visual direction. Completed voice
sessions show their total voice minutes once beside the session's first message.

## Chat (P4-06)

The conversation panel keeps one message list, a Danish/English selector, and a
labelled text composer. Sending saves Dan's message first, then streams Jarvis's
reply in place. Pending state keeps the Send control disabled; failures remain
beside the composer, preserve partial text as interrupted, and warn that a task
action may have completed. A delivered reply is saved and history refreshes so
tool outcomes and valid task IDs appear as labelled chips and links. The list and
composer stay in the existing single-column conversation panel at mobile widths;
the selected visual direction remains open. P4-09 routes chat through Foundry
Invocations; live Azure streaming and tool-call linkage remain a post-merge check.

## Browser voice (P5-04)

The Voice section uses the existing neutral panel and replaces unavailable
actions with Start voice, Stop voice, and Mute/Unmute. Connection, listening,
thinking, speaking, reconnecting, and failure feedback stays beside those controls; the
mute action is unavailable until a session is ready. The microphone opens only
after session setup and the Danish no-model warm-up complete. Speaking
interrupts playback. Controls wrap on narrow screens and use the shared 44 px
button and visible-focus styles. Language selection and voice settings remain
with P5-05; no new visual direction is chosen. A headless Chromium check at
390 px and 1280 px verified the layout and start, speaking, interruption,
reconnect, mute, and stop states with mocked relay/audio APIs. Physical
microphone and speaker behavior remains unverified. Stop shows "Saving voice
session…" until the backend has recorded usage, then refreshes conversation
history.

## Next-generation shared shell (design agreed, not implemented)

[ui.md](ui.md) records the confirmed structure, open questions, feature-placement
proposals and eight static wireframes. Typing uses a thin left icon rail,
expandable left navigation, thin top/bottom bars, a contextual right panel and
a central tabbed workspace. Settings is top-right. Voice hides the shell and
composer, using a full-page background and a state-driven orb: centred alone,
left of content windows on desktop, bottom-docked behind one main phone view.
Windows can tile, overlap, minimise into tabs and be restored by Dan or Jarvis.

Existing windows carry between modes by default. The optional minimise-on-voice
setting defaults off; when enabled, voice begins with only the orb and windows
remain docked on return to typing. Otherwise the earlier shell layout returns.
Generated views are temporary; theme values persist. Small-orb input controls
start voice explicitly. Glass/transparency and futuristic styling are exploratory;
white wireframe windows are not a selected final treatment. Existing screen
documentation below/above describes current implementation, not this future shell.

## Proposed surfaces for accepted capability additions

Editable personality should live in **Settings → Jarvis → Personality**, reached
through the agreed top-right Settings entry. Proposed fields are tone/response
style and custom instructions, with Save and Reset to the current default and
clear new-session application feedback. This placement is a recommendation, not
a newly reviewed screen design. P8-19 owns the form; P7-16 owns its validated
persistence and chat/voice application. Visual themes remain separate.

Research and generated image/video results use the existing dynamic workspace,
with source links or artifact references and honest progress/error states.
Memory can be queried, corrected and forgotten through registered tools; a
dedicated memory-management screen has not been selected. Reuse the agreed shell
and view contracts rather than adding permanent rail/top-bar controls for each
new capability.
